EXTRACT ARCHIVE(S)
From the system 
- rightclick on the archive(s) and in system’s context menu click "Extract here" or "Extract here (smart new folder)" to extract with no further interaction. Smart new folder option takes care to create a new top level folder only if necessary, when the archives root contains more than one file or folder.
- otherwise use "Extract..." menu entry for having more options: output path, password, extract files to a new directory, chose to skip, rename or overwrite existing files etc.

Open an archive in PeaZip, i.e. with doubleclick, or drag an archive on PeaZip’s window or icon
- click on "Extract" in toolbar or in context menu to extract only selected objects trough the confirmation dialog allowing to set all options (output path, password, naming policy, extract to a new directory etc)
- drag files and folders to the desired destination, only selected content will be extracted (for more information see chapter about drag and drop in PeaZip)
- click the quick extraction dropdown button on the right of “Extract” in the toolbar, it allows to directly extract the entire archive to most common destinations (skipping the confirmation dialog) and to set most important options; keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+E (or F12) extracts the entire archive, asks for output directory; Ctrl+Alt+E extracts archive in its current folder; Ctrl+Shift+E extracts to desktop; Ctrl+Alt+Shift+E extracts to documents; Ctrl+0 extracts to previous path; Ctrl+1..8 extracts to path of bookmark 1..8 (if defined)

Open PeaZip, select one or more archives and click “Extract” in toolbar or context menu, or use quick extraction destinations as explained at the previous point.

EXTRACT ONLY SELECTED OBJECTS FROM THE ARCHIVE
Open an archive in PeaZip, i.e. with doubleclick, or drag an archive on PeaZip’s window or icon
- click "Extract" in toolbar: only selected items will be extracted
- drag files and folders to the desired destination, only selected content will be extracted
- rightclick and in “Extract” group of the context menu click “Extract selected” (to extract only selected items) or “Extract displayed” (to extract content of current directory or of current search filter)

ENTER A PASSWORD TO BROWSE OR EXTRACT AN ARCHIVE
Click on the padlock icon to enter a password and optionally a keyfile.
The icon is featured both in PeaZip’s file browser’s status bar and in the archive extraction interface; once the password is set the icon will change color.

CREATE ARCHIVE
From the system
- rightclick on objects to be archived and click on "Add to archive" in context menu or SendTo menu. It will open the archive creation confirmation dialog, more options are available in “Advanced” tab; click OK to create the archive.
- alternatively, drag files/folders to PeaZip’s window or shortcut; the same archive creation interface will be shown.

From PeaZip 
- select objects to be archived and click on "Add" button; the same archive creation interface will be shown.

ADD FILES/FOLDERS TO UPDATE EXISTING ARCHIVE
Open an archive in PeaZip (i.e. with doubleclick, or drag an archive on PeaZip’s window or icon), then drag files and folders to be added in the archive (or click on "Add" button and use application's context menu to add objects to the archive).
It will open the archive creation confirmation dialog, click OK to update the existing archive.

CREATE ARCHIVE SPLIT IN SMALLER FILES
While creating an archive as explained in previous points, click on “Single volume” dropdown menu to select a size for output files (volumes) the archive will be split in.
Most common types of archives supports this option.

CREATE ENCRYPTED ARCHIVE
Click on the padlock icon to enter a password and optionally a keyfile; the icon is featured both in PeaZip’s file browser’s status bar and in archive creation interface.
To hide names of files and directories contained in the archive check “Encrypt also filenames”, please note that it will be applied only if the archive will be created in a format supporting this function, like 7Z and ARC.
Note that in archive creation interface, alongside the padlock icon, there is a warning to visually inform if encryption is set and if the current archive format supports encryption.

CREATE SEPARATE ARCHIVES
Add objects to be archived (with PeaZip’s "Add" button, or from system’s context menu or SendTo menu) and before confirming with "Ok" check "Add each object to a separate archive" option.

CONVERT ARCHIVES
From PeaZip select archives to be converted and click on "Convert" on toolbar or context menu, non-archive files and folders can be added as well, the difference being in archives being extracted before compression stage.
Using the “Convert existing archives” switch in conjunction with “Add each object to a separate archive" (default) it performs a mass conversion of listed archives, without that switch archive conversion is meant to consolidate input data in a single archive, improving compression efficiency because it allows recompression of the original data from its uncompressed form.

DIRECTLY CREATE ARCHIVES IN A SPECIFIED FORMAT AND WITH A CHOSEN COMPRESSION LEVEL
Using “System integration” procedure in Options menu it is possible to enable context menu entries to directly add selected files/folders to a ZIP, 7Z or self extracting archive.
For Zip and 7Z formats it is also possible to enable context menu entries to compress to fastest, normal or ultra level, bypassing the default compression level for the selected format.

PASSWORD MANAGER
Password manager is accessible from main menu, Tools > Password manager or from Password form, from drop down menu on the left of Password field.
Saved passwords can be selected from the dropdown menu on the left of password filed in Password form, or can be copied from password manager to be used in any other application.
If no master password is set for the password manager, the password list is accessible without prompting for authentication, otherwise passwords will not be displayed until the user correctly authenticates.

CONFIGURE THE APPLICATION
Options > Localization (and in Options > Settings, first tab) allows to set application’s language.
Options > Settings allows to edit applications’ settings
Options > Theme allows to change application’s icons and appearance
Options > System integration starts a procedure to configure file associations, context menu and SendTo menu entries (on Windows)
Organize menu contains entry to customize, enable or disable browser’s features, like toolbar, address bar, navigation bar, etc
