Icoana este prezenta atat in bara de stare a exploratorului de fisiere PeaZip, ca si in interfata de creare a arhivelor; odata ce parola este setata, icoana isi va schimba culoarea.

CREARE ARHIVA
Din sistem
- click-dreapta pe obiectele ce trebuiesc arhivate si click pe "Adaugare la arhiva" in meniul contextual sau pe meniul TrimitereCatre. Se va deschide fereastra pentru confirmarea crearii arhivei, mai multe optiuni sunt disponibile in fila "Avansat"; click pe OK pentru a crea arhiva.
- ca metoda alternativa, trageti fisiere/dosare in fereastra sau in scurtatura programului PeaZip; acceasi interfata pentru crearea de arhive va fi afisata.

Din PeaZip 
- selecteaza obiectele ce trebuie arhivate si fa click pe butonul "Adauga"; aceeasi interfata de creeare a arhivelor va fi afisata.

ADAUGARE FISIERE/DOSARE PENTRU ACTUALIZAREA ARHIVEI EXISTENTE
Deschide o arhiva in PeaZip (de ex. prin dublu-click, sau prin tragerea arhivei in fereastra Peazip sau pe icoana Peazip), apoi trageti fisiere si dosare pentru a le adauga la arhiva (sau faceti click pe butonul "Adaugare" si folositi meniul contextual al aplicatiei pentru a adauga obiecte in arhiva).
Va deschide fereastra de confirmare a crearii arhivei, faceti click pe OK pentru a actualiza arhiva existenta.

CREARE ARHIVA DESPICATA IN MAI MULTE FISIERE MAI MICI
In timpul crearii unei arhive asa cum a fost explicat la punctele anterioare, faceti click pe meniul derulant "Volum unic" (single volume) pentru a selecta o marime pentru fisierele de iesire (volume) in care arhiva va fi despicata.
Tipurile de arhive cele mai des intalnite suporta aceasta optiune.

CREARE ARHIVA CRIPTATA
Click pe icoana lacat pentru a introduce o parola si, optional, un fisier-cheie; icoana este prezenta atat in bara de stare a exploratorului de fisiere PeaZip, ca si in interfata de creare a arhivelor.
Pentru a ascunde numele fisierelor si directoarelor continute in arhiva, bifati "Cripteaza si numele fisierelor". Tinei minte ca aceasta optiune va fi aplicat doar daca arhiva va fi creata intr-un format de fisier ce suporta aceasta functie, precum 7Z sau ARC.
Note that in archive creation interface, alongside the padlock icon, there is a warning to visually inform if encryption is set and if the current archive format supports encryption.

CREARE ARHIVE SEPARATE
Adaugati obiectele ce trebuiesc arhivate (cu butonul "Adaugare" din PeaZip, sau din meniul contextual al sistemului de operare ori din meniul TrimitereCatre) si inaintea confirmarii cu butonul "OK", bifati optiunea "Adaugare fiecare obiect intr-o arhiva proprie (separata)".

CONVERSIE ARHIVE
Din PeaZip selectati arhive pentru a fi convertite si faceti click pe "Convertire" din bara de unelte sau din meniul contextual; fisiere care nu sunt arhive, precum si dosare, pot fi adaugate deasemenea, diferenta fiind ca arhivele vor fi extrase inaintea fazei de compresie.
Folosind comutatorul "Convertire arhive existente" in conjunctie cu "Adauga fiecare obiect intr-o arhiva proprie" (implicit), va avea ca rezultat o conversie in masa a arhivelor din lista. Fara activarea acelui comutator, conversia de arhive este destinata sa consolideze datele de intrare intr-o singura arhiva, imbunatatind astfel eficienta comprimarii deoarece permite recompresia datelor originale din forma lor necomprimata.

CREARE DIRECTA A ARHIVELOR INTR-UN FORMAT SPECIFICAT SI CU UN NIVEL DE COMPRESIE ANUME ALES
Folosind procedura “Integrare in sistem" din meniul Optiuni se pot activa comenzile din meniul contextual ce permit adaugarea directa a fisierelor/dosarelor selectate la o arhiva ZIP, 7Z sau la o arhiva autoextractiva.
Pentru formatele Zip si 7Z este deasemenea posibila activarea optiunilor din meniul contextual referitoare la nivelul de compresie: rapida, normala sau nivel ultra de compresie, sarind peste nivelul implicit de compresie al formatului de arhiva selectat.

MANAGER DE PAROLE
Managerul de Parole este accesibil din meniul principal, Unelte > Manager de Parole sau din Formularul Parola, din meniul derulant situat in stanga campului Parola.
Parolele salvate pot fi selectate din meniul derulant situat la stanga parolei completate in Formularul Parola, sau pot fi copiate din managerul de parole pentru a putea fi utilizate in alte aplicatii.
Daca nicio parola generala (master password) nu este setata pentru managerul de parole, atunci lista cu parole este accesibila fara a fi necesara autentificarea, in caz contrar parolele nu vor fi afisate pana cand utilizatorul nu se autentifica (in mod corect).
