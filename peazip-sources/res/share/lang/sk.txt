ROZBAĽOVANIE ARCHÍVOV
Zo systému 
- kliknite pravým tlačidlom na archív a z kontextovej ponuky vyberte "Extract here" alebo "Extract here (in new folder)" pre priame rozbalenie
- inak vyberte "Extract...", ak chcete určiť cieľ uloženia súborov, heslo, uložiť súbory do iného priečinka, preskočiť, premenovať, prepísať existujúce súbory apod.

Otvorte archív PeaZipom, t. j. dvojklikom alebo pretiahnutím do okna alebo na ikonu PeaZipu 
- kliknite na "Rozbaliť" v paneli nástrojov alebo v menu, ak chcete rozbaliť iba vybrané objekty s upresnením a nastavením ďalších možností (cesta pre uložení súborov, heslo, premenovanie, uloženie do nového priečinka apod.)
- pretiahnite súbory a priečinky do požadovaného umiestnenia. Rozbalený bude len označený obsah (ďalšie podrobnosti nájdete v kapitole Pretiahni a pusť v PeaZipe).
- pre rýchle rozbalenie kliknite na menu vpravo od "Rozbaliť" na paneli nástrojov. Môžete priamo rozbaliť celý archív do prednastavených umiestnení (po preskočení potvrdzovacieho dialógu) a nastaviť najdôležitejšie možnosti. Klávesové skratky: Ctrl+E (alebo F12) rozbalí celý archív a bude sa pýtať na cieľový priečinok, Ctrl+Shift+E rozbalí do dokumentov, Ctrl+1..8 rozbalí do umiestnenia prednastavených v Záložkách 1 až 8 (ak sú definované)
 
Spustite PeaZip, vyberte jeden alebo viac archívov a kliknite na "Rozbaliť" v paneli nástrojov alebo kontextovej ponuke alebo použite rýchle rozbalenie ako bolo popísané vyššie.

ROZBAĽOVANIE LEN NIEKTORÝCH OBJEKTOV Z ARCHÍVU
Otvorte archív v PeaZipe (dvojklikom alebo pretiahnite do okna alebo na ikonu PeaZip)
- kliknite na "Rozbaliť" v paneli nástrojov. Rozbalia sa iba vybrané objekty
- pretiahnite súbory alebo priečinky do požadovaného umiestnenia. Rozbalia sa iba vybrané objekty
- kliknite pravým tlačidlom a v skupine "Rozbaliť" použite "Rozbaliť vybrané objekty" (pre rozbalenie vybraných položiek) alebo "Rozbaliť zobrazené objekty" (pre rozbalenie aktuálneho priečinka alebo aktuálneho filtrovaného obsahu)

PREHLIADANIE ALEBO ROZBAĽOVANIE ARCHÍVOV CHRÁNENÝCH HESLOM
Kliknite na ikonu zámku a zadajte heslo prípadne keyfile.
Ikona zámku je v PeaZipe dostupná v stavovom riadku správcu súborov i v rozhraní pre rozbaľovanie súborov. Po vložení hesla sa zmení farba ikony.

VYTVÁRANIE ARCHÍVU
Zo systému
- kliknite pravým tlačidlom na objekty, ktoré chcete archivovať a vyberte "Add to archive" v kontextovej ponuke alebo Odoslať kam menu. Otvorí sa dialóg pre vytváranie archívu, podrobnosti je možné nastaviť na záložke "Pokročilé nastavenia". Vytvorenie archívu potvrdíte kliknutím na "OK". 
- môžete tiež pretiahnuť súbory a priečinky do okna alebo na ikonu PeaZipu. Otvorí sa rozhranie pre vytváranie archívu.

Z PeaZipu
- vyberte objekty k archivácii a kliknite na tlačidlo "Pridať". Otvorí sa rozhranie pre vytváranie archívu. 

PRIDÁVANIE SÚBOROV A PRIEČINKOV DO EXISTUJÚCEHO ARCHÍVU
Otvorte archív v PeaZipe (napr. dvojklikom  alebo pretiahnutím na ikonu PeaZipu) a potom pretiahnite pridávané súbory a priečinky do archívu (alebo stlačte tlačidlo "Pridať" a použite pre pridanie objektov do archívu kontextovú ponuku aplikácie). 
Zobrazí sa potvrdzovací dialóg a po stlačení "OK" bude existujúci archív aktualizovaný.

VYTVÁRANIE ARCHÍVU ROZDELENÉHO DO MENŠÍCH SÚBOROV
Pri vytváraní archívu, ako už bolo popísané vyššie, kliknite na rozbaľovaciu ponuku "Jeden zväzok", kde je možné vybrať veľkosť vytváraných súborov (zväzkov), na ktoré bude výsledný archív rozdelený.
Túto možnosť podporuje väčšina archivačných formátov.

VYTVÁRANIE ŠIFROVANÉHO ARCHÍVU
Kliknite na ikonu zámku a vložte heslo, prípadne keyfile. Ikonu nájdete v stavovom riadku prieskumníka PeaZip a v rozhraní pre vytváranie archívu.
Pre ukrytie názvov súborov a priečinkov obsiahnutých v archíve použite "Šifrovať tiež názvy súborov". Táto možnosť však bude použitá iba pri typoch archívov, ktoré to umožňujú, ako napríklad 7Z a ARC.
V rozhraní pre vytváranie archívu nájdete vedľa ikony zámku informáciu o stave šifrovania a šifrovacích možnostiach vybraného formátu. 

VYTVÁRENIE ODDELENÝCH ARCHÍVOV
Pridajte súbory na archiváciu a pred potvrdením tlačidlom "OK" začiarknite možnosť "Každý objekt do vlastného archívu".

PREVOD ARCHÍVOV
V PeaZipe vyberte archívy, ktoré chcete konvertovať, kliknite na "Konverzia" v paneli nástrojov alebo v kontextovej ponuke. Môžete pridať aj obyčajné súbory alebo priečinky. Odlišnosť od obyčajného pridania je, že pôvodný archív je najskôr celý rozbalený. 
Možnosť "Konverzia existujúcich archívov" zároveň s "Každý objekt do vlastného archívu" (predvolené) vykonáva hromadný prevod vypísaných archívov. Bez tejto možnosti má konverzia archívov v úmysle konsolidáciu vstupných údajov do jedného archívu a zvýšenie účinnosti kompresie, pretože to umožňuje znovuskomprimovanie pôvodných údajov z nekomprimovaného tvaru.

PRIAME VYTVÁRANIE ARCHÍVOV V DANOM FORMÁTE A KOMPRESNOM POMERE
Možnosťou "Systémová integrácia" z ponuky Možnosti je možné povoliť položky kontextovej ponuky pre priame pridávanie súborov a priečinkov do archívov typov ZIP, 7z a samorozbaľovacích archívov.
Pre formáty ZIP a 7z je tiež možné povoliť položky kontextovej ponuky pre priamu kompresiu s možnosťou najrýchlejšia, ultrarýchla a normálna metóda kompresie bez nutnosti ďalšieho potvrdzovania v dialógu.
