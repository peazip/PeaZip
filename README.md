PeaZip free archiver
======

PeaZip is a free zip file utility and rar extractor for Windows and Linux, work with 150+ archive types and variants (7z, ace, arc, bz2, cab, gz, iso, paq, pea, rar, tar, wim, zip, zipx...), handle spanned archives (001, r01, z01...) and support multiple archive encryption standards.

The project aims to provide a cross-platform, portable, GUI frontend for multiple Open Source technologies (7-Zip, FreeArc, PAQ, PEA, UPX) focused on file and archive management, and security (strong encryption, two factor authentication, encrypted password manager, secure delete).

The program is written in Lazarus / FreePascal (Windows installable packages are scripted with InnoSetup) and offers a LGPLv3 alternative to proprietary software (WinZip, WinRar, etc), running as native application on Windows/Win64, Wine/ReactOS, and Linux x86/x86-64, with Linux ARM and BSD ports also available.
