          o built Windows standalone and installable versions, tested on 98, 2000 and XP;
          o Windows installer: the program is now installed in "Programs" path with shortcuts in "SendTo"; setup creates by default file association only with .pea and .001 (split file's first volume) formats and asks to optionally associate other filetypes (.7z, .bz2, .gz, .tar, .Z, .zip) with PeaZip;
          o shell integration: created shortcut in "SendTo" to send files and folders to PeaZip, and multiple shortcuts with fixed paramstr(1) to quick access to most used PeaZip functions:
                + add to archive (.7z, .pea, .zip types) or self-extracting archives (7z compressed);
                + encrypt files and folders (.pea encrypted archive);

                + test and list archive(s), allowing parallel testing or listing of multiple archives of composite types at once;
          o fixed some Windows 9x-specific issues: the code about disabling transparency support for that platform doesn't longer rise errors; TSpinEdit component behaves correctly;
          o "Archive" features:
                + UI improvements: single step to archive, introduced "Passes" option in 7za frontend (Deflate, Deflate64 and BZip2), changed "fast" and "fastest" settings in 7za frontend (Deflate and Deflate64) for high speed compression, customised icons of 7-zip's sfx modules;
                + resolved issues: in Linux version is now possible to choose compression level parameter (7za frontend); changing archive type no longer reset custom archive name, raw file split no longer loose original file extension;
          o "Open" features:
                + introduced filters support for selective partial extraction (or listing) of content from 7za-supported archives;
                + UI improvements: created [#] label to quick listing archive's content (7za archives only), extract to new folder yes/no option (7za frontend) promoted to a separate option group, output selection now uses a folder selection dialog.

# 2006 11 06

          o various interface improvements; used some icons from Tango Project.
